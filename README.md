# Snake-ai

This is a world simulation based on the snake game however, here the snake population is not limited to 1. Also the snakes evolve their genes to allow them to grow longer and have more offspring. The program also displays some of the statistics of the population and shows the thinking patterns of the best performing snake.

This is one of my earlier projects so many things were done wrong but it was a good learning experience.
